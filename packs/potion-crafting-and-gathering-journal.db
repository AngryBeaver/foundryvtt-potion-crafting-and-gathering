If the DM allows it, a +3 can be added to the check for each additional 30 minutes spent on investigating the area to a maximum of +6. The player can repeatedly search an area without repercussions on the amount of ingredients obtained from an area.</p><section><h1>Rules for Harvesting</h1><p>Once a herb or fungi is identified and the player is proficient with the herbalism kit, they can throw a d20 and add their proficiency bonus and their Potion Making Level modifier (See final page) to that throw to determine if they can harvest the ingredient. Harvesting an ingredient takes 30 minutes. If the DM allows it, a +3 can be added to the check for each additional 30 minutes spent on gathering the ingredient to a maximum of +6.

The workdays don’t have to be subsequent and can be broken down further into single hours of work, with each workday is lasting 8 hours. If the DM allows it, the player may spent more than 8 hours a day working on their project. The player is allowed to spent their long rest working on their project if they are under the influence of items like Midnight oil or features like the warlock's Aspect of the moon. Progress done this way is at half the normal rate.</p><p>After the player has spent the required time working on the potion, they roll a d20, add their proficiency and their Potion Making Level modifier (See next page) to the total. If the player makes the check, the product is successfully completed. If the player fails the check, they are allowed to recover the ingredients, though lose the gold invested.</p></section><section><h1>Pricing Guide</h1><p>The total cost of a potion is predetermined.
